## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Simple CSS custom properties: flex-direction, font-family, border-radius



### What I learned

I learned some CSS properties, like how to center a div, how to manage elements for a better render, how to change font-family


Some code I'm proud of

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  /*centrer l'element*/
    position: absolute;
    margin: auto;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
}
```

I'v also learn how to manipulate GIT with my Terminal.

### Continued development

I want to learn about responsive design in my future projects with Media Queries.

### Useful resources

- [Learn GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud#copy-and-add-files) - This helped me for manipulate GIT. I really liked this memo it's very usefull.
- [How to center in CSS](https://la-cascade.io/centrer-en-css-un-guide-complet/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. It's in french but you can translate.
